The fonts used in this template are:
- Figtree, which is used for headings, headers and captions. You can download it at #link("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree")
- Georgia, which is used for body text. It is a serif font that is based on Times New Roman, but adapted slightly for legibility on screens. It is included in windows (and Mac too I think), so no need for any installation there.
- STIX Two Math, which is used for the math environment. This is used by IEEE in their templates and is available though the STIX project at #link("https://github.com/stipub/stixfonts/releases").

You can find references and tutorials for Typst in their web app #link("https://typst.app/") or on their github page #link("https://github.com/typst/typst")
